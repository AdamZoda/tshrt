# Hoodie Implementation Plan

This plan covers the addition of a Hoodie model to the Studio, allowing users to switch between T-Shirts and Hoodies.

## Proposed Changes

### 3D Components

#### [MODIFY] [ShirtModel.tsx](file:///c:/Users/user/Documents/t%20dener/tshrt-main/src/components/3d/ShirtModel.tsx)
- Add a `modelPath` prop to [ShirtModel](file:///c:/Users/user/Documents/t%20dener/tshrt-main/src/components/3d/ShirtModel.tsx#90-128) to switch between [/tshirt.glb](file:///c:/Users/user/Documents/t%20dener/tshrt-main/public/tshirt.glb) and `/hoodie4.glb`.
- Ensure materials are correctly applied to the Hoodie nodes (checking for node names).
- Optimize decal projection for the hoodie geometry.

## Proposed Changes

### 3D Components

#### [MODIFY] [ShirtModel.tsx](file:///c:/Users/user/Documents/t%20dener/tshrt-main/src/components/3d/ShirtModel.tsx)
- Rename or refactor to `ProductModel.tsx` (or keep and make it generic).
- Add logic to load different GLB files based on a `type` prop (`tshirt` vs `hoodie`).
- Adjust decal positions if the Hoodie geometry differs significantly.

### Studio Page

#### [MODIFY] [Studio.tsx](file:///c:/Users/user/Documents/t%20dener/tshrt-main/src/pages/Studio.tsx)
- Integrate Hoodie as a first-class product in the `displayProducts` array.
- Update the UI to show a clean toggle or selection for T-Shirt vs Hoodie.
- Ensure state persists correctly when switching models.
- Validate that `design_data` correctly identifies the selected model.

## Verification Plan

### Automated Tests
- Build check to ensure no JSX errors.
- Console log verification for model loading.

### Manual Verification
- Switch between T-Shirt and Hoodie in the Studio.
- Apply decals to both and ensure they persist when switching (or handle reset logic).
- Verify color changes apply to both models.

### Syntax Error Check (Final Step)
- Run `npx tsc --noEmit` to detect all TypeScript/JSX syntax errors across the project.
- Fix any reported syntax errors (missing brackets, unclosed tags, typos, etc.).
- Re-run the check until the build compiles with **zero errors**.
